# Fab Lab Management System

The Fab Lab Management System is designed to enhance the functionality of open labs, specifically Fab Labs, by implementing an open-source management system. This system aims to improve safety, integrity, productivity, and efficiency through a human-centered design with low-cost implementation and a web interface, facilitating scalability to other open labs globally.<br />
Key features include an automated machine access control, restricting machine access to authorized users based on roles and safety instructions using RFID chips. The system centralizes lab management, saving staff time, automating processes, and sending reminders. Additionally, it documents maintenance, supports broken machine repairs, and gathers usage data for AI-supported pattern analysis.
